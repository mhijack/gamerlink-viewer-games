# GamerLink Viewer Games Widget

**A demo widget built for GamerLink App's viewer games feature.** (resize your browser window to see responsiveness!)

There are 3 states the user can toggle:
1. Extra description expanded / hidden
2. Joined / unjoined the queue
3. Intermediate state: button will be disabled while waiting for joining / unjoining to complete. (setTimeout is used to simulate communication with server)
